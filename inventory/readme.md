Need to write a spring-boot application with a REST controller, which expose a Swagger API catalog.

The application needs to expose the following APIs:


•	List of the inventory items list (item no, name, amount, inventory code)
•	Read item details (by item no)
•	Withdrawal quantity of a specific item from stock
•	Deposit quantity of a specific item to stock
•	Add item to stock
•	Delete an item from stock  
•	Data should be persisted on H2 DB using JPA.
•	Need to pack and run the application from docker.
•	Need to send a link to GitHub for source and docker hub for docker image
•	Need to return the exercise in a week.

Bonus points for creating Angular pages which enable to create/read/update and/delete the item.
